            <ul>
                <li>BREATHE : You might be tempted to hold your breath while you're lifting weights. Don't hold your breath. Instead, breathe out as you lift the weight and breathe in as you lower the weight.</li>
                <li>SEEK BALANCE : Work all of your major muscles — including the abdomen, hips, legs, chest, back, shoulders and arms. Strengthen the opposing muscles in a balanced way, such as the fronts and backs of the arms.</li>
                <li>REST : Avoid exercising the same muscles two days in a row. You might work all of your major muscle groups at a single session two or three times a week, or plan daily sessions for specific muscle groups. For example, work your arms and shoulders on Monday, your legs on Tuesday, and so on.</li>
                <li>USE PROPER FORM : Learn to do each exercise correctly. When lifting weights, move through the full range of motion in your joints. The better your form, the better your results, and the less likely you are to hurt yourself. If you're unable to maintain good form, decrease the weight or the number of repetitions. 
                    Remember that proper form matters even when you pick up and replace your weights on the weight racks.</li>
                <li>DON'T OVERDO : For most people, completing one set of exercises to the point of fatigue is usually enough. Additional sets may take up extra time and contribute to overload injury. However, the number of sets that you perform may differ depending on your fitness goals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tips On Weight Loss</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> ELIMINATE SUGARY DRINKS : Staying away from these beverages entirely can provide enormous long-term health benefits. However, note that you should not replace soda with fruit juice, as it can be just as high in sugar.</li>
                <li>SLEEP WELL AND AVOID STRESS : When it comes to health, people often neglect sleep and stress. Both, in fact, have powerful effects on your appetite and weight. A lack of sleep may disrupt the appetite-regulating hormones leptin and ghrelin. Another hormone, cortisol, becomes elevated when you’re stressed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tips On Building Muscle</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>DON'T SKIMP ON CARBS : Eat sufficient carbohydrates! If you exercise hard and long with cardio, circuits or bodybuilding programs, you need sufficient carbohydrate to fuel your efforts and to maintain body stores of glucose.</li>
                <li>EAT PROTEIN : Eat sufficient protein. Even if you train hard, the maximum amount of protein you need for muscle building is just less than 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.</li>     
            </ul>
